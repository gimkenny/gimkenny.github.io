  This paper presents the Finger-Mounted Extending Rod, a wearable device that transforms fingers into virtual tools by modulating fingertip mass distribution. The system employs linear actuators on finger that extend or retract metal rods according to finger poses, generating rotational inertia while redirecting the hand to natural grip postures. Through three user studies, we evaluate (1) finger pose embodiment under visual redirection and tool matching via inertia tensor similarity, (2) perception of tool length and rotational inertia, and (3) tool identification accuracy and user experience. Results show that 10 of 15 poses maintained embodiment, with inertia tensor similarities of 0.936–0.991 for tool-pose pairs. Users perceived inertia with 4.19–10.45× amplification and achieved 52.9% identification accuracy, exceeding chance level (16.7%). The Inertia-aligned condition enhanced immersion, realism, and enjoyment compared to Inertia-misaligned and No-Finger Rod conditions across six VR scenarios. We conclude by discussing how the system rendering virtual tools without handheld controllers.
