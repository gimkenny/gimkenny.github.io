  We present a novel approach to in-car virtual reality (VR) that reimagines vehicle-generated forces not as artifacts to suppress, but as immersive feedback cues for enhancing presence and interaction. We introduce the concept of force mappings, a design space that translates vehicle-induced forces such as acceleration, turns, and road texture into ambient environmental representations within VR environments. Implemented on a real vehicle platform with a sensor-based pipeline, our system applies four representative mapping strategies (Ground-based, Wind-based, Current-based, Object-based) and evaluates their perceptual coherence and experiential effects through two respective user studies. Results show that force mappings can improve presence, comfort, and engagement while enabling creative reinterpretations of physical motion. Finally. we provide empirical findings and design guidelines that position vehicle motion as a generative medium for multisensory in-car VR applications.
