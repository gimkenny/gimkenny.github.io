abstract: >-
  We demonstrate a novel in-car Virtual Reality (VR) platform that provides multisensory feedback without requiring external hardware. Our system leverages the vehicle's Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and power seat systems to generate synchronized thermal, airflow, and motion feedback. These physical sensations are designed to operate in coordination with the visual experience, enhancing a passenger's sense of presence while reducing the potential for motion sickness. This demonstration shows how existing automotive components can be transformed into an effective and scalable platform for immersive entertainment.
