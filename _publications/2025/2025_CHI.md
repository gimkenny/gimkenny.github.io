  We explore the feasibility of active user-applied locomotion in virtual reality (VR) within in-car environments through a two-step study, by examining the effects of locomotion method on user experience in dynamic environments as well as evaluating contextual cues designed to mitigate sensory mismatch posed by vehicle movement. The first study evaluated five locomotion methods, identifying joystick-based navigation as the most suitable for in-car use due to its low physical demand and stability within the dynamic vehicle environment. The second study focused on designing and testing various contextual cues that translate vehicle movements into virtual effects, aiming to integrate sensory inputs from the vehicle without limiting the userâ€™s freedom of movement. Along with results in which the implemented contextual cues effectively lowered motion sickness and increased presence, we conclude with a set of initial insights and design considerations into expanding the range of potential in-car VR applications by enabling active locomotion.
