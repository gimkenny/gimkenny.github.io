  This paper proposes an Augmented Virtuality (AV)-based system that enables real-time extraction, visualization, and interaction with a user's actual hands within a virtual environment. To overcome the limitations of conventional 3D model-based hand representations, the system utilizes egocentric RGB video captured by a ZED Mini stereo camera and applies the Robust Video Matting (RVM) model to segment the hand region. The segmented hands are then visualized within a Unity-based virtual environment. Despite its simple hardware configuration and low computational latency, the system achieves high visual fidelity and demonstrates the feasibility of various hand-based interactions by integrating with Oculus hand tracking capabilities.
