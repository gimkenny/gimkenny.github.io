  In-car VR applications typically synchronize virtual motion with real vehicle movement to minimize visual-vestibular mismatch. However, this approach limits virtual movement to directions in which the vehicle can physically move, typically restricting the experience to horizontal motion. This study introduces a method to expand the range of virtual motion by simulating vertical movement, leveraging vehicle acceleration to induce a vertical pitch illusion via manipulation of gravitoinertial perception. We conducted a two-phase study evaluating (1) optimal vertical gain values for maximizing perceptual realism in a controlled environment and (2) user experience factors such as motion sickness and presence in an on-road VR flight simulation under realistic driving conditions. Our findings show that users tend to prefer vertical gains that exceed theoretically valid mappings, and highlight the importance of aligning virtual motion with perceived inertial cues to enhance the realism and coherence of vertical motion in in-car VR applications.
