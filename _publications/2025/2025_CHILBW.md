 Teleportation, a method of instantly moving users to a target position, has become a widely adopted locomotion method in virtual reality. However, the lack of proprioceptive feedback for teleportation can diminish presence and increase workload, thereby limiting the overall user experience. In this study, we propose TeleHopper, a system that enhances the teleportation experience by simulating the sense of jumping during teleportation through Electrical Muscle Stimulation-based haptic feedback. TeleHopper induces leg movements resembling a jumping motion and adjusts stimulation intensity based on travel distance, creating a realistic proprioceptive perception of leaping through space during teleportation. Experimental results evaluating TeleHopper's user experience showed a significant enhancement in sense of presence, as well as a significant reduction in mental workload. Through this study, we demonstrate TeleHopper's ability to deliver compelling proprioceptive feedback in teleportation, with varying stimulation intensity enhancing realism and aiding travel distance estimation.
