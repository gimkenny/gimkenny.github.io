abstract: >-
  This study proposes a wearable system that delivers a synesthetic user experience by analyzing the user's emotional state in real time while listening to music and providing corresponding thermal stimuli. The proposed system estimates the emotional content of music based on the Arousal‚ÄìValence model and maps this emotional information to temperature stimuli delivered through a Peltier-based thermal feedback device. This research quantifies the systematic relationship between musical emotions and physical thermal stimuli and extends this relationship into an affective interface grounded in emotion‚Äìtemperature correlations. Ultimately, the study contributes to the design of emotion-centered immersive interaction systems.
