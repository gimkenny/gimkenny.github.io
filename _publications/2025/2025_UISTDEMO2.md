  We demonstrate EarPressure VR, a novel haptic system that enhances environmental presence in virtual reality by simulating atmospheric pressure changes through controlled air pressure modulation in the user's ear canal. The system uses a VR headset with sealed earbuds and a motor-driven syringe to safely generate pressure variations that simulate sensations like underwater depth or high-altitude environments (within Â±40hPa of the ambient level). Attendees will experience two interactive scenarios: a gradual underwater descent, feeling a steady increase in inward pressure synchronized with depth; and instantaneous portal travel between high- and low-pressure worlds, feeling sudden and distinct environmental shifts. This demonstration showcases how leveraging the ear canal as a haptic channel can create more physically grounded and immersive virtual experiences.
