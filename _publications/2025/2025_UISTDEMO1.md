abstract: >-
  We introduce AttraCar, a multisensory in-car Virtual Reality (VR) platform that delivers thermal, airflow, and motion feedback using built-in vehicle systems. By controlling the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system and the power seat, our platform enables the creation of multisensory, hardware-free in-car VR designed to enhance immersion and mitigate motion sickness. This demonstration allows attendees to experience these effects firsthand, showcasing a practical and scalable approach for future immersive automotive applications.
