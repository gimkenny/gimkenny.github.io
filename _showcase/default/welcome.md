    <h2>Welcome to My Showcase!</h2>

    <p>
        This is where I display many of the projects that I created. Most of them involve some kind of interaction in VR/AR, such as visualizing and physically presenting real objects within the virtual space or dynamically adjusting the virtual contents to contextualize vehicle motion for in-car VR users. These projects are closely connected to my research aims of enabling more freedom, comfort and immersion into virtual activities. Please feel free to contact me for additional data (code, builds)!
