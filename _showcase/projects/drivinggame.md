  <h3 class="mt-3">An Interactive VR Driving Game encouraging Active Locomotion in In-Car VR</h3>
  <p>
    This project is a spinoff from my published CHI LBW paper "Curving the Virtual Route: Applying Redirected Steering Gains for Active Locomotion in In-Car VR". The paper is in regards to enjoying the capabilities of user-applied active locomotion in VR contents for passengers in-car, while previous applications involved synchronization of motion between the real and virtual vehicle. The background for the user study was reformatted into an interactive virtual driving game, with steering enabled through a Logitech G3 wheel mounted in front of the passenger.
